      <p>
        Chris Henrick is a web developer, GIS specialist, and cartographer who currently lives in
        San Francisco, California. Most recently he worked for <a target="_blank" href="http://stamen.com">Stamen Design</a>,
        an internationally renowned data visualization and web cartography studio, as a Design Technologist. He is an
        alumnus of the  <a href="http://www.newschool.edu/parsons/mfa-design-technology/" target="_blank">
          MFA in Design and Technology at Parsons School For Design</a> in New York City where he
        broadened his technical skills in web-development and web-design with a focus on user experience,
        data visualization, and story telling with interactive web-mapping. His thesis at MFA DT was a
        civic web app he conceptualized and coded called <a target="_blank" href="https://amirentstabilized.com"><em>Am I Rent Stabilized?</em></a>
        that seeks to solve the problem of NYC landlords lying to tenants about rent-stabilization and illegally deregulating
        rent-stabilized apartments. You can learn more about it in
        <a target="_blank" href="http://urbanomnibus.net/2015/05/using-open-data-to-strengthen-tenants-rights-activism/">
          an article he wrote for Urban Omnibus.</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Chris has consulted in web development and cartographic design for organizations such as Stamen Design,
        Pratt’s Spatial Analysis and Visualization Initiative, and Radish Lab. Prior to attending Parsons MFA DT,
        Chris worked as the Lead Cartographer and GIS Specialist at Avalon Travel Publishing in Berkeley, CA. He originally
        got his start in “Geo” as a GIS / Cartographer Intern at GreenInfo Network in San Francisco, CA in 2010.
        His undergraduate degree is in Geography and Urban Studies, from Temple University in Philadelphia, PA.
      </p>
      <p>
        When not at work Chris enjoys bicycling, hiking, and playing music. As a believer in open knowledge and
        skill sharing, he has assisted with organizing and facilitating Maptime, a community of professionals
        dedicated to educating non-experts about GIS, cartography, and interactive web mapping; free of charge.
