<div id="about">
<p>
      My current work in cartographic design stems from a combined love of drawing and exploration. 
      As a youngster I would spend endless hours drawing from life or imagination in the form of comic books and other illustrations. 
      When not sitting inside at a desk or table I would often explore the outdoors where I lived, taking long walks through nature or bicycle rides through my town. 
      Later in early adulthood I chose to pursue the fine arts in drawing, printmaking, and painting at University of the Arts in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. 
      After realizing that a career as a fine artist was not my true calling I left art school 
      first for several years as a bicycle messenger and then as a student of Geography and Urban Studies at Temple University. 
      At Temple I became enthralled with issues pertaining to human and physical geography, the environment and society, political ecology, and social justice.
      It was at Temple where I first was exposed to the disciplines of GIScience and cartographic design.<br><br>
      Upon completing my undergraduate degree at Temple, I embarked on a cross-country bicycle tour of the northern United States and Pacific Coast, eventually landing in my current home of Oakland, California. 
      My most recent work experience in the San Francisco Bay Area has enabled me to successfuly develop skills in visualizing information through cartographic design. 
      It is here in making maps where I have developed a keen eye for the hierarchal organization of detailed information while simultaneously striving to seek an aesthetic of balance, order, and legibility in my work.  
      <br><br>
      I am currently consulting in the field of <em>digital cartography</em> while continuing to grow my skill set in programming, front-end web development, and 
      open-source web mapping. Please do not hesitate to contact me regarding inquiries on potential projects; whether you may need an elegant map for a wedding invitation, 
      a locator map for your business flyer or webpage, or for a story for whose audience would benefit from understanding its geographic relevance.
      Whatever your geospatial design challenge may be, I look forward to hearing from you.
